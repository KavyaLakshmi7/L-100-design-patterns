# ðŸŽ­ Decorator Design Pattern â€“ Example: Game Character Power-Ups

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

The **Decorator Pattern** allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class.

In this example:

* A **Basic Character** starts with a default description and power level.
* Using **Power-Up Decorators** (Speed Boost, Shield, Double Damage), we can dynamically enhance the character.
* The pattern lets us "wrap" the character with new abilities at runtime.

This avoids subclass explosion (we donâ€™t need a class for every possible combination of power-ups).

```
       Character (interface)
       + getDescription()
       + getPower()
              ^
              |
   ----------------------------
   |                          |
BasicCharacter        PowerUpDecorator (abstract)
                             ^
                             |
        ----------------------------------------
        |                  |                  |
   SpeedBoost           Shield         DoubleDamage
```

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Participants

1. **Component (Character)** â†’ Defines the interface (`getDescription()`, `getPower()`).
2. **Concrete Component (BasicCharacter)** â†’ Base object that can be decorated.
3. **Decorator (PowerUpDecorator)** â†’ Abstract class that holds a reference to a `Character` and forwards calls.
4. **Concrete Decorators (SpeedBoost, Shield, DoubleDamage)** â†’ Add new behavior (increase description + power).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Flow of Execution

1. Player starts as a **Basic Character** (power = 10).
2. Each chosen **Power-Up** wraps the existing character.

   * Example: `new SpeedBoost(new BasicCharacter())`
3. The result is a chain of decorators that build up the characterâ€™s powers.
4. The client (Game) treats everything as a `Character`, without caring if itâ€™s a base or decorated object.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Run

```
Your character starts as: Basic Character (Power: 10)

Choose a power-up:
1. Speed Boost (+5 power)
2. Shield (+8 power)
3. Double Damage (+15 power)
4. Exit
Enter choice: 1

Current Character: Basic Character + Speed Boost (Power: 15)

Choose a power-up:
1. Speed Boost (+5 power)
2. Shield (+8 power)
3. Double Damage (+15 power)
4. Exit
Enter choice: 3

Current Character: Basic Character + Speed Boost + Double Damage (Power: 30)

Game Over! Final Character: Basic Character + Speed Boost + Double Damage (Power: 30)
```

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Decorator Pattern

âœ… **Flexibility** â€“ Add features at runtime without modifying the base class.
âœ… **Avoids subclass explosion** â€“ Instead of dozens of combinations (e.g., `ShieldedSpeedBoostedCharacter`), we just compose decorators.
âœ… **Open/Closed Principle** â€“ Existing code remains untouched; new power-ups can be added easily.
